        This dashboard explores the level of alcohol consumption by people of various countries and continents around 
        the world and the various related factors. This helps readers, and specifically those who consume alcohol or 
        are interested in the domain, in understanding a multitude of factors which highlight certain trends one sees 
        in their own drinking patterns or those around them. 
       <br> 
       <br> 
        We will first obtain an overview of relative consumption between different countries through the use of a choropleth 
        map where the Pure Alcohol in Litres has been normalised based on each country's average.
       <br> 
       <br>
        Next, we will gauge how the different factors (explained on the right) are related using a correlation plot. Interesting 
        patterns observed will be further explored as we move down the dashboard.

          <p> Looking at the correlations holistically, the strongest correlation is between Alcohol (Litres) and Beer Servings, 
            with a correlation of 0.84 which highlights that beer is a popular beverage among countries with higher consumption rates,
            followed by spirit servings and then wine servings. Other than this, there is no other significant correlations when 
            taking all continents into consideration. 
            <br>
            To note which beverage is most popular based on each continent, we can look at the relative correlations between Alcohol 
            (Litres) and Beer, Spirit, and Wine Servings. These relative differences are emphasied in the chart below.

          <p> Looking at the heatmap holistically (taking all continents into consideration), a strong positive trend is observed.
            An increase in pure alcohol is correlated with an increase in the average happiness score.
            <br>
            <br>
            There are no countries with an average happiness score < 4 and average alcohol consumption > 6L, meaning that there are no countries with 
            a combination of a low happiness score and relatively high alcohol consumption. HOWEVER, there are also no countries with an 
            average happiness score > 6 and averagge alcohol consumption > 12L, meaning that an excess of alchol is also not good. A similar pattern is 
            observed in North America, South America and Europe.
            <br>
            <br>
            Overall, the happiest countries are those that drink between 8-10L while the unnhappiest countries are those that drink between 0-6L.

        In the above plot it is evident that there is a strong positive relationship between suicide and alcohol consumption. 
        This relationship is particularly prevalent in Europe, Oceania, and Asia. Africa has a sligght positive relationship but 
        mostly plateaus out at higher alcohol consumption. 
        <br>
        <br>
        On the other hand, North America has a cluster towards the bottom centre of the chart and does not show any 
        significant trend. The same is observed in North America with the exception of two outliers, Suriname, and Guyana which 
        have a much higher suicide rate than the cluster of other South American countries.

        Oceania has a cluster of countries towards the lower ennd of both suicide rate and alcohol consumptionn with 
        the exception of: New Zealand, Australia and Palau which still have a relatively losw suicide rate but a higher 
        alcohol consumption. 
        <br>
        <br>
        What is interesting to note is that there is a general positive correlation between alcohol consumption and suicide rate but 
        also a positive correlation between alcohol consumption and happiness scores (but to a ceratin extent).
